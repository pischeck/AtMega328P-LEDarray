The project is built on an Atmega328P microcontroller in a DIP package. 
The microcontroller is connected to eight LEDs arranged side by side and four buttons. 
The LEDs light up in pairs and move sideways. 
The buttons can be used to control the speed or stop the movement.
In the schematic folder there is a connection diagram for the microcontroller
